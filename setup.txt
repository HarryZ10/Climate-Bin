You need to get set up with two services in order to use this template.  If you are in a group, you can have one 
group member do this.

The first is Google Cloud. To do this:
### This will not work with your OUSD account so you need to use a personal email account ###
1) Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard
    Here is a video of the process:
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lB2RDJe9CD1eeHFYwFn3aQT-7dt_YuuO/view
2) Log in with your personal email credentials 
3) At the top of the screen click the project pulldown menu and then click "New Project" in the top left of the next window
   then click the three lines in the top left to get a menu
4) Give the project a descriptive name like the name of your app and click Create
5) Click the three lines in the top left of the screen, and click API's & Services and then click Credentials
6) You will probably be asked to fill out some fields for the "Consent Screen".  The only important part is that you click 
    the option to allow people "outside of your organization" to access your app.  If you do not do that then only you will be 
    able to login.  The reset of the options are not important for how your app works
    but are important for communicating to your user what they are consenting to.  Fill it out.
7) Click Create Credentials and then click OAuth Client ID
8) Then click Web Application, 
9) Give this a descriptive name like the name of your app.
10) You can leave javascript origins blank
11) in authorized redirect URI's you need to put both:
    https://localhost:5000/oauth2callback
    https://127.0.0.1:5000/oauth2callback
12) Click Create
13) You should now be on the Credentials page for you project. it should say "Client ID for Web application" 
    at the top and next to that it should say Download JSON.  Click download JSON.
14) The JSON file you download you need to rename as "credentials.json" and put it at the same 
    level of flask app as the main.py file.

The next is mongodb.com where you will create your database and all the data from your site will be stored.
Here is a link to video I made about the process for getting a mongodb.com account:
1) Watch the video at this link
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tDZzE4Yb2C8OK6MXn4n_8LgQyHFr9eCW/view
    to see how to get an account at mongodb.com and find the code you need to include in your app.
1) At the end of the video you will have copied a string that looks like this:
    mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0-8m0v1.gcp.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority   
    and now you need to paste it in to your app. 
2) Go to the __init__.py file in the app folder (app/__init__.py) and replace the connect string that is there
    and replace <dbuser> with the username you just created
    and replace <dbpassword> with the password you just created
2) take that string and place it in the __init__.py file in the app folder

### Final steps ###

Now you need to install all of python packages you need.  To do this, open the terminal via your editor 
(Atom or visual code studio - I definitely recommend using Visual Code Studio) and run the following
two commands:

conda activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

You should be ready to go!

To run your app simply run the main.py file with the python command
